# Defense Communication System

## Description
The Defense Communication System is a Java-based application developed in NetBeans IDE and designed to facilitate efficient communication between various military units such as helicopters, tanks, and submarines. This system allows these units to share information in real-time with a main control room, ensuring coordinated and effective operations during warfare. The project utilizes Object-Oriented Programming **(OOP) concepts**, **abstraction**, **polymorphism**, and several **design patterns** including **Observer-Observable**, and **Singleton**.



## Features

- **Tank Class:** Represents a tank within the defense system. It includes functionalities such as: Monitoring the tank's status including fuel level, ammunition count, and energy level. Controlling the tank's operations such as shooting, missile deployment, and radar operations. Sending and receiving updates to and from the main controller.

- **Submarine Class:** Represents a submarine within the defense system. Similar to the Tank class, it includes functionalities for monitoring, controlling, and updating the submarine's status and operations.

- **Helicopter Class:** Represents a helicopter within the defense system. It provides functionalities for monitoring, controlling, and updating the helicopter's status and operations.
